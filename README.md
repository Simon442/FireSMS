# FireSMS

App was intended to be used by Slovene volunteer fire departments where alarming is heavily dependant on SMS. It would read certain keyword or a phone number and then release loud beeping sounds and open a window where user could press 3 buttons to either confirm he's responding, coming later or not coming (which is monitored by system SMS gets sent from). Due to lack of time and a completly new system coming in place for the departments which has its own app, I decided that project is permanently shutting down until I find another use for it.
